Human actions classifier with Graph Convolutional Networks

Study of graphical convolutional neural networks with a real application : worked on physiotherapeutic movement classification for rehabilitation with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) using NTU-RGB Dataset which contains different data on the joints of the human skeleton, captured by Kinect. The purpose of this project was to be a spatio-temporal classification.

The file ntu_dataset_gcn.py contains classes to create DGL dataset and to design the struture of graph convolutional network with method for training and validation.

Packages used :
  - Deep Graph Library
  - PyTorch
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Networkx
